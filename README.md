# Uncommon HTML DOM Manipulation Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to DOM manipulation in HTML. The bug occurs because the script attempts to access and modify a DOM element ('myDiv2') before the element has been fully loaded and parsed by the browser. This often results in a silent failure with no error message.

## Bug Description
The HTML file includes a script that tries to change the innerHTML of an element with the id 'myDiv2'. However, this element does not exist in the HTML. This type of error is difficult to debug because it doesn't produce a traditional JavaScript error message. It will simply fail silently. 

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the script runs after the DOM is fully loaded. This can be accomplished using the DOMContentLoaded event listener.
